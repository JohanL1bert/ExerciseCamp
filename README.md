2. The decorators allows objects to add new behaviors by placing them in wrapper objects. For example, you have a def function and you need to add something(some logic, new fields, argument and etc) but not changing the main structure of def fuction. You can create decorator, new def function and transfer necessary values there .  Deocarators piece of code can be used to another functions.
It's very useful when you need to add new behavior method for complete function or script.
